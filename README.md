# Queues-Simulator--Java
The main objective of this project is to design and implement a system for simulate a queuing based system for determining a task’s waiting time and also to minimalize it, this application should also calculate the average time for waiting time spent at the queues.  To achieve such a goal, we have to implement a thread based algorithm and a handler to start each of the task’s thread and for the servers known as queues also.
